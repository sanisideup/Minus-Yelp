# sanisideup-yelpfusion
A winning submission for Capital One's Engineering Summit

Deployed website on Heroku: https://immense-brushlands-27696.herokuapp.com/

Built on Ruby with Sinatra framework, HTML, and CSS (with a side of sweat and tears).

My first ever excursion into the world of web development.

I updated the site for two small fixes I caught after submission:
- I accidentally linked the same url variable for each search result (<%= url_0 %>).
- I forgot to hide the Client ID and Client Secret after testing

Update: Currently implementing Groupon API to search through discounts to implement in search requests
