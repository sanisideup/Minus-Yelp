# sanisideup-yelpfusion
Submission for Capital One's Engineering Summit

Deployed website on Heroku: https://immense-brushlands-27696.herokuapp.com/

Built on Ruby with Sinatra framework, HTML, and CSS (with a side of sweat and tears).

From the beginning I wanted to give the user less choices. I personally get decision fatigue. Each decision chisels down my mental capacity for the day. I can focus on important decisons by only returning the top three responses from Yelp.
